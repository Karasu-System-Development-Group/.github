# Karasu System Development Group  
We build ideas. We shape systems.

At Karasu, we focus on crafting experimental, efficient, and elegant solutions — from game engines and embedded systems to user-facing apps and AI-driven tools.  
We're passionate about code, obsessed with innovation, and always working on the edge of what's possible.
